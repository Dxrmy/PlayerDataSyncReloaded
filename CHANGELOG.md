# Changelog

All notable changes to PlayerDataSyncReloaded will be documented in this file.

## [26.5.4-Release] - 2026-05-05
### Fixed
- **Build Process**: Redirected final shaded JAR output to the root build directory for easier access.
- **Database Migration**: Added automatic schema migration for SQL storage to fix "Unknown column" errors when upgrading from older versions.
- **Legacy Fallback**: Implemented automatic fallback to the legacy data format if the new JSON format is missing in SQL storage.

## [26.5.3-Release] - 2026-05-05
### Changed
- **Paper Compatibility**: Updated NMS support for the stable Paper 26.1.2 release.
- **Dependency Management**: Updated internal version modules to target the latest stable API builds.

## [26.5.1-Release] - 2026-05-01
### Fixed
- **Thread Safety**: Resolved `IllegalStateException` on Paper/Purpur servers where `PlayerDataSaveEvent` was incorrectly triggered on the main thread while marked as an asynchronous event. Both Save and Load events are now synchronous to ensure full compatibility with the Bukkit threading model.

### Added
- **API Extensibility**: Added `extraData` map to `PlayerData` for third-party plugin data synchronization.

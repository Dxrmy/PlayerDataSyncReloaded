# Changelog

All notable changes to PlayerDataSyncReloaded will be documented in this file.

## [26.5.5.1-ALPHA] - 2026-05-20
### Added
- **Fabric**: `fabric-api` (`0.92.2+1.20.1`) so lifecycle and server-play networking APIs resolve at compile time; `fabric.mod.json` declares a `fabric-api` dependency.
- **Velocity**: Gradle task `generatePluginBuildInfo` emits `PluginBuildInfo.VERSION` so the `@Plugin` version always matches the Gradle project version.
- **Modrinth / Fabric**: Guide [`pds-docs/modrinth-upload.md`](pds-docs/modrinth-upload.md) (Paper vs Fabric JAR); Gradle task **`checkFabricModMetadata`** asserts `fabric.mod.json` exists in the remapped Fabric JAR; Fabric archive base name **`playerdatasync-fabric`** so it is not confused with the Paper plugin artifact.
- **Unified distribution JAR**: The Paper **`PlayerDataSyncReloaded-*.jar`** (also copied to **`build/libs/`**) embeds **`bundled/playerdatasync-velocity.jar`**, **`bundled/playerdatasync-fabric.jar`**, and **`bundled/playerdatasync-forge.jar`** plus **`bundled/README.txt`** — one download; extract sibling JARs for Velocity/Fabric/Forge (classes are not merged to avoid mapping clashes).

### Changed
- **Gradle / bytecode targets**: `api` and `common` use **Java 17** (Fabric/Forge); **`plugin`** and **Velocity** use **Java 21** so **Paper 1.21.x** can remap the shaded plugin (ASM does not accept class file **69**). Nested **`:versions:*`** modules are set to **21** in **`versions/build.gradle.kts`** (they are not root `subprojects`, so they previously picked up the toolchain default and emitted **69**).
- **Velocity**: `velocity-api` updated to **3.5.0-SNAPSHOT**; Velocity→backend plugin messages use **UTF-8** (`StandardCharsets.UTF_8`); `ServerConnectedEvent` log line uses **`event.getServer().getServerInfo()`** (Velocity 3 API).
- **Shadow plugin**: Replaced `com.github.johnrengelman.shadow` **8.1.1** with **`com.gradleup.shadow` 8.3.10** so `shadowJar` can process modern class files when relocating (e.g. bundled jars).
- **Forge**: `META-INF/mods.toml` version is expanded from Gradle (`mod_version`); Forge `build.gradle.kts` no longer overrides root `version` / `group`.
- **Fabric**: `build.gradle.kts` no longer overrides root `version` / `group` (single version from `gradle.properties`).
- **Gradle runtime**: **Configuration cache disabled** in `gradle.properties` (ForgeGradle, Fabric Loom, and Shadow-related flows are not reliable with CC enabled); parallel and build caching remain enabled.
- **CI**: Workflow runs **`./gradlew :plugin:build`** and uploads the unified **`build/libs/PlayerDataSyncReloaded-*.jar`** (includes **`bundled/`** platform JARs).

### Fixed
- **Bukkit version handlers**: `v1_20_R1` and `v26_1_R1` `VersionHandlerImpl` now extend **`BukkitBaseVersionHandler`** and implement **`capture` / `apply` with `PDSPlayer`** (restores compatibility after removal of `BaseVersionHandler`).
- **Fabric** `PlayerDataSyncFabric`: `ServerPlayNetworking` global receiver is registered in **`SERVER_STARTING`** after storage/`SyncManager` setup; SLF4J error logging for storage init; guards when `syncManager` is not ready yet.
- **Forge** `PlayerDataSyncForge`: storage init failures use **Log4j** instead of `printStackTrace`; packet and login handlers guard **`syncManager == null`**.
- **Multi-platform build**: Resolved Gradle dependency variant mismatches (Fabric vs `api`/`common` JVM level). **`v26_1_R1`**: `compileClasspath` requests JVM **25** so Paper 26 `paper-api` resolves while sources still compile with **`--release 21`**.

### Notes
- **One JAR download**: `build/libs/PlayerDataSyncReloaded-*.jar` contains Paper + **`bundled/`** Velocity/Fabric/Forge JARs; Modrinth still needs the **extracted** platform files per loader (see `pds-docs/modrinth-upload.md`).
- **Modrinth**: Use **`bundled/playerdatasync-fabric.jar`** (extracted from the distribution JAR) for the Fabric loader file — not the outer archive root (that is the Paper plugin with **`plugin.yml`** only).
- **Paper 1.21.x**: The main plugin classes are built as **Java 21 bytecode** so the server’s **PluginRemapper** can read them. Run the server on **Java 21+** as required by Paper 1.21. **Deploy the JAR whose name matches `gradle.properties` `version`** (e.g. **`PlayerDataSyncReloaded-26.5.5.1-ALPHA.jar`**); delete any older file such as **`PlayerDataSyncReloaded-26.5.5-SNAPSHOT.jar`** from `plugins/` so Paper does not remap a stale build. The shaded jar **excludes `META-INF/versions/**`** so multi-release dependency layers (class file 69) are not shipped to the remapper.

## [26.5.5-ALPHA] - 2026-05-05
### Added
- **Initial Development**: Preparing for new features in the upcoming 26.5.5 release.

## [26.5.4-Release] - 2026-05-05
### Fixed
- **Build Process**: Redirected final shaded JAR output to the root build directory for easier access.
- **Database Migration**: Added automatic schema migration for SQL storage to fix "Unknown column" errors when upgrading from older versions.
- **Legacy Fallback**: Implemented automatic fallback to the legacy data format if the new JSON format is missing in SQL storage.

## [26.5.3-Release] - 2026-05-05
### Changed
- **Paper Compatibility**: Updated NMS support for the stable Paper 26.1.2 release.
- **Dependency Management**: Updated internal version modules to target the latest stable API builds.

## [26.5.1-Release] - 2026-05-01
### Fixed
- **Thread Safety**: Resolved `IllegalStateException` on Paper/Purpur servers where `PlayerDataSaveEvent` was incorrectly triggered on the main thread while marked as an asynchronous event. Both Save and Load events are now synchronous to ensure full compatibility with the Bukkit threading model.

## [26.5-Release] - 2026-04-27
### Added
- **API Extensibility**: Added `extraData` map to `PlayerData` for third-party plugin data synchronization.
- **Save Cancellation**: `PlayerDataSaveEvent` now implements `Cancellable`, allowing plugins to prevent data from being saved under specific conditions.
- **Granular Sync Controls**: Added new configuration options to disable syncing for Potion Effects, Food, GameMode, Advancements, and Statistics.
- **Improved Version Detection**: Better handling for Minecraft 1.21.1 and future sub-versions.

### Changed
- **Banner Update**: Refreshed the startup banner with new colors and "Expansion Update" subtitle.
- **Performance**: Minor internal optimizations for event handling.

### Fixed
- Potential edge case where data might save during an invalid state.


## [26.4-Release] - 2026-04-18
### Added
- **Storage Migrator**: Full release of the migration tool for seamless transitions between SQL and NoSQL.
- **Zipped Backup System**: Reliable export/import system for disaster recovery.
- **Legacy Migration Support**: Bridge for users coming from the original PlayerDataSync version.
- **Vault Economy Sync**: Stable cross-network balance synchronization.
- **Advanced Sync Features**: Full support for PDC, Attributes, Statistics, and Advancements.
- **Auto-Save System**: Background saving task to prevent data loss.
- **Exclusion System**: World and item blacklists for granular control.

### Changed
- **Modernized Version Support**: Dropped legacy support. Now exclusively supporting **1.20, 1.21, and 26.1+**.
- **Performance Optimizations**: GZIP compression and dedicated thread pools are now enabled by default.

### Fixed
- All issues discovered during the Beta phase, including NMS fallback and thread safety.

- **Zipped Backup System**: Added `/pds backup export/import` for portable data management and safety.
- **Legacy Migration Support**: Added specialized support to migrate data from the old PlayerDataSync version to the new Reloaded format.
- **Vault Economy Sync**: Full synchronization for player balances across the network.
- **Advanced Sync Features**: Added support for Persistent Data Containers (PDC), modern Attributes, Statistics, and Advancements.
- **Auto-Save System**: Automated background saving of all online players to prevent data loss on server crashes.
- **Exclusion System**: Added blacklists for specific worlds and items (by material) to prevent them from being synchronized.
- **Management Commands**: Added `/pds reload` for hot-reloading connections and `/pds migrate` for data transfers.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Configurable chat messages for players during synchronization events.

    - Introduced **Dedicated Thread Pools** for all database I/O to ensure the main server thread is NEVER blocked.
    - Added **Inventory Hashing** to skip redundant database writes if data hasn't changed.
- **Simplified Architecture**: Refactored the core logic into a cleaner multi-module system.
- **Banner**: Updated the startup console banner for a premium look.
